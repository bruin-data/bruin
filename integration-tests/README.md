# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the Bruin data pipeline tool. These tests verify that Bruin works correctly with real pipelines, databases, and various configurations.

## Overview

The integration tests are designed to test Bruin's functionality in realistic scenarios, including:

- **Individual Tasks**: Testing specific Bruin commands and features
- **Workflow Tests**: Testing multi-step workflows and state management
- **Ingestr Tests**: Testing integration with the Ingestr data ingestion tool

## Test Structure

### Test Files

- `integration_test.go`: Main test file containing all integration tests
- `test-pipelines/`: Directory containing test pipeline configurations

### Test Categories

1. **Individual Tasks** (`TestIndividualTasks`): Tests for specific Bruin commands

2. **Workflow Tests** (`TestWorkflowTasks`): Tests for multi-step workflows

3. **Ingestr Tests** (`TestIngestrTasks`): Tests for Ingestr integration

### Make Commands

The following make commands are available for running integration tests:

#### Run Full Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all integration tests (including ingestr tests)
make integration-test

# Run all integration tests in parallel
ENABLE_PARALLEL=1 make integration-test
```

#### Run Integration Tests Without Ingestr Tests

```bash
# Run only individual task tests
make integration-test-light
# Run only individual task tests in parallel
ENABLE_PARALLEL=1 make integration-test-light
```

**Note**: `ENABLE_PARALLEL=1` enables parallel test execution. By default, tests run sequentially.

## Test Pipeline Structure

Each test pipeline in `test-pipelines/` should follow a standard structure:

```
test-pipelines/
├── pipeline-name/
│   ├── pipeline.yml          # Pipeline configuration
│   ├── assets/               # Pipeline assets (SQL, Python, etc.)
│   │   ├── asset1.sql
│   │   └── asset2.py
│   └── expectations/         # Expected outputs (if applicable)
│       ├── expected.json
│       └── expected.csv
```

### Test Isolation
Each test runs in isolation with:
- Clean temporary directories
- Fresh database instances
- Isolated file systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Binary Not Found**: Ensure Bruin is built before running tests
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure write permissions for temporary directories

3. **Ingestr Tests Failing**: Rerun tests. If that doesn't help, verify Ingestr is properly configured if running ingestr tests
