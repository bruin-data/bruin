### Getting Started
#### Create your first Bruin project

To create a bruin project basic structure you can just run


   ```
   bruin init {folder name} [template name]
   ```

If you don't define folder name and template name. It will create `default` template with folder name bruin-pipeline. This command will:

    Create a project named bruin-pipeline 
    Generate a folder called bruin-pipeline containing the following:
        -  An assets folder (where you add asset file)
        - .bruin.yml file (where connection and credentials are added)
        -  pipeline.yml file to manage your pipeline

#### Adding a new asset

Adding a new [asset](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/assets/ingestr.html) is as simple as creating a new file inside the assets folder. Let's create a new [ingestr asset](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/assets/ingestr.html) file `asset.ingetsr.notion.yml` inside assets folder and add :

 ```
name: public.notion
type: ingestr
connection: my-postgres

parameters:
  source_connection: my-notion
  source_table: 'database_id'

  destination: postgres
 ```

- name: The name of the asset.

- type: Specifies the type of the asset. It will be always ingestr type for Notion.

- connection: The name of the connection

- source_connection: The name of the Notion connection defined in .bruin.yml.
- source_table: The database id of Notion you want to ingest.
- destination: The name of the destination, you want to store. Here, we are using postgres sql


#### Adding connection and credentials in .bruin.yml 
Make sure, you have [Notion credentials](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/notion#setup-guide) and Postgres credentials.

Using Bruin vscode extension
- Add destination connection - PostgresSQL
- Add source connection - Notion

You can customize your pipeline by adding in pipeline.yml
- You can change schedule to daily, weekly or monthly.

#### Validate and Run your pipeline
- bruin CLI can run the whole pipeline or any task with the downstreams.
`Make sure, asset file is open`
