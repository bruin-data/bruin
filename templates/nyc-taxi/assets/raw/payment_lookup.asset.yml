  Loads the payment type lookup table from local CSV file.
  This table contains payment type information including payment_type_id and payment_description.
  The lookup table is a static reference table that maps payment type codes to human-readable descriptions.

  Design Choices:
  - Why read from local CSV:
    - Payment type codes are standardized and do not change frequently
    - Local seed file provides version control and reproducibility

  - Why seed file:
    - Seed files are a convenient way to load static data into a database
    - Seed asset automatically materializes into a table on each run

columns:
  - name: payment_type_id
    type: INTEGER
    description: Numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip
    primary_key: true
    nullable: false
  - name: payment_description
    type: VARCHAR
    description: Human-readable description of the payment type
