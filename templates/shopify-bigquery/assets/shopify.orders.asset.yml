  This asset manages the ingestion of Shopify inventory item data into BigQuery. It captures comprehensive inventory tracking 
  information including SKUs, shipping requirements, measurement details, and variant relationships. The asset tracks both 
  basic inventory attributes and advanced features like duplicate SKU detection and inventory tracking settings. Data quality 
  checks ensure critical fields like inventory item ID are properly populated. This table serves as the source of truth for 
  product inventory management, supporting both tracked and untracked inventory items with their associated variant details.
