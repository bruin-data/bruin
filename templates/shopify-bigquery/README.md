# Bruin - Shopify to BigQuery

This pipeline is a simple example of a Bruin pipeline that copies data from Shopify to BigQuery. It demonstrates how to use the `bruin` CLI to build and run a pipeline.

The pipeline includes two sample assets already:
- `raw.shopify`: A simple ingestr asset that takes copies a table from Notion to BigQuery

## Setup
The pipeline already includes an empty `.bruin.yml` file, fill it with your connections and environments. You can read more about connections [here](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/connections/overview.html).

Here's a sample `.bruin.yml` file:

```yaml
default_environment: default
environments:
    default:
        connections:
            google_cloud_platform:
                - name: "gcp"
                  service_account_file: "/Users/yuvraj/Workspace/bruin/service-account.json"
                  project_id: "bruin-common-health-check"

            shopify:
                - name: "my-shopify-connection"
                  api_key: "********"
                  url: "******.myshopify.com"
```

## Running the pipeline

bruin CLI can run the whole pipeline or any task with the downstreams:

```shell
bruin run assets/shopify.asset.yml
```

```shell
❯ bruin run ./templates/shopify-bigquery/                                                       (bruin)

You can optionally pass a `--downstream` flag to run the task with all of its downstreams.

That's it, good luck!
