DONE 1. Create platform config struct (define connection names, schema patterns, exit codes, etc.)
DONE 2. Create new test file: cloud-template_test.go
DONE 3. Template one common test: SCD2-by-column
DONE . Test with 2-3 platforms (e.g., Postgres, Snowflake, BigQuery) to validate approach
5. Iterate based on learnings before templating more tests

6. Move expectations
7. Move test into own folder including .cloud.bruin.yml and update tests
8. Add matrix for which tests apply to which platforms 
9. add all final tests



Improvements

use asset flag for all tests
