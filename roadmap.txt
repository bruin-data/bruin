1. Create platform config struct (define connection names, schema patterns, exit codes, etc.)
2. Create new test file: cloud-template_test.go
3. Template one common test: SCD2-by-column
4. Use already existing pipelines for now (no need to template SQL files yet)
5. Test with 2-3 platforms (e.g., Postgres, Snowflake, BigQuery) to validate approach
6. Iterate based on learnings before templating more tests



Improvements

use asset flag for all tests
