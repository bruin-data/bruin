# Intercom

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is a customer messaging platform that helps businesses engage with their customers through personalized, messenger-based experiences. This source enables you to extract comprehensive data from the Intercom API, including contacts, companies, conversations, tickets, and more.

To set up an Intercom connection, you need to have an Access Token that has the necessary permissions for the resources you want to access.

## Set up a connection

Intercom connections are defined using the following properties:

- `name`: The name to identify this connection
- `access_token`: Your Intercom Access Token (required)
- `region`: The Intercom region for your app (optional, defaults to "us"). Supported regions: "us", "eu", "au"

:::code-group
```yaml [connections.yml]
connections:
  intercom:
    - name: "my_intercom"
      access_token: "your_access_token_here"
      region: "us"
```
:::

You can also use environment variables in your connections.yml by using the `&#123;&#123; env_var("ENV_VAR_NAME") &#125;&#125;` syntax.

For example:
```yaml
connections:
  intercom:
    - name: "my_intercom"
      access_token: "&#123;&#123; env_var('INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN') &#125;&#125;"
      region: "us"
```

## Supported Data Assets

Intercom assets will be ingested to your data warehouse as defined in the `destination` table.
