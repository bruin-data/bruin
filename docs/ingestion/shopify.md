# Shopify
[Shopify](https://www.Shopify.com/) is a comprehensive e-commerce platform that enables individuals and businesses to create online stores.

Bruin supports Shopify as a source for [Ingestr assets](/assets/ingestr), and you can use it to ingest data from Shopify into your data warehouse.

In order to set up Shopify connection, you need to add a configuration item in the `.bruin.yml` file and in `asset` file. You need the `url` of your Shopify store and the `api_key`. For details on how to obtain these credentials, please refer [here](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/shopify#setup-guide).

Follow the steps below to correctly set up shopify as a data source and run ingestion:

### Step 1: Add a connection to .bruin.yml file
To ingest data from Shopify, you need to create an [asset configuration](/assets/ingestr#asset-structure) file. This file defines the data flow from the source to the destination. Create a YAML file (e.g., shopify_ingestion.yml) inside the assets folder and add the following content:

```yaml
   connections:
    shopify:
        - name: my-shopify
          url: test.myshopify.com
          api_key: abckey
```
- `api_key`: the API key used for authentication with Shopify

### Step 2: Create an asset file for data ingestion

```yaml
name: public.shopify
type: ingestr
connection: postgres

parameters:
  source_connection: my-shopify
  source_table: 'orders'

  destination: postgres
```
- `name`: The name of the asset.
- `type`: Specifies the type of the asset. It will be always ingestr type for Shopify.
- `connection`: This is the destination connection.
- `source_connection`: The name of the Shopify connection defined in .bruin.yml.
- `source_table`: The name of the data table in shopify you want to ingest. For example, "order" would ingest data related to order.You can find the available source tables in Shopify [here](https://bruin-data.github.io/ingestr/supported-sources/shopify.html#available-tables)

### Step 3: [Run](/commands/run) asset to ingest data
```     
bruin run assets/shopify_ingestion.yml
```
As a result of this command, Bruin will ingest data from the given Shopify table into your Postgres database.
