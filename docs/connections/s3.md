# S3
[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a bucket for storing data in Amazon's Simple Storage Service, a cloud-based storage solution provided by AWS. S3 buckets allow users to store and retrieve data at any time from anywhere on the web.

ingestr supports S3 as a source for [ingestr assets](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/assets/ingestr.html), allowing you to ingest data from S3 into your data warehouse.

In order to have set up S3 connection, you need to add a configuration item to `connections` in the `.bruin.yml` file complying with the following schema. For more information on how to get these credentials check the S3 section in [Ingestr documentation](https://bruin-data.github.io/ingestr/getting-started/quickstart.html)

```yaml
    connections:
      s3:
        - name: "connection_name"
          bucket_name: "my_bucket"
          path_to_file: "users.csv"
          access_key_id: "xyz123"
          secret_access_key: "L56gabc"
