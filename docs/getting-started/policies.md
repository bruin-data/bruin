# Policies

Bruin supports **policies** to verify that data transformation jobs follow best practices and organisation wide conventions. In addition to built-in lint rules, Bruin also allows users to define **custom lint rules** using a `policy.yml` file.

This document explains how to define, configure, and use custom linting policies.

## Quick Start

1. Create a `policy.yml` file in your project root.
2. Define custom rules under `custom_rules` (optional if only using built-in rules).
3. Group rules into `rulesets`, specifying which assets they should apply to using selectors.

Example:

```yaml
rulesets:
  - name: ruleset_1
    selector:
      - path: .*/foo/.*
    rules:
      - asset_has_owner
      - asset_name_is_lowercase
      - asset_has_description
```

ðŸš€ That's it! Bruin will now lint your assets according to these policies.

To verify that your assets satisfy your policies, you can run:

```sh
$ bruin validate /path/to/pipelines
```

> [!tip]
> `bruin run` normally runs lint before pipeline execution. So you can rest assured that any non-compliant assets will get stopped in it's tracks.

## Rulesets

A **ruleset** groups one or more rules together and specifies which assets they apply to, based on selectors.

Each ruleset must include:
- **name**: A unique name for the ruleset.
- **selector** (optional): One or more predicates to select the applicable assets.
- **rules**: List of rule names (built-in or custom) to apply.

If a **selector** is not specified, the ruleset applies to **all assets**.

### Selector Predicates

Selectors determine which assets a ruleset should apply to. Supported predicates are:

| Predicate | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `path` | path of the asset |
| `asset` | name of the asset |
| `pipeline` | name of the pipeline |
| `tag` | asset tags |

Each predicate is a regex string.

::: info
If multiple selectors are specified within a ruleset, **all selectors must match** for the ruleset to apply
:::

If no selectors are defined for a ruleset, **the ruleset applies to all assets**.

### Example

```yaml
rulesets:
  - name: production
    selector:
      - path: .*/prod/.*
      - tag: critical
    rules:
      - asset_has_owner
      - asset_name_is_lowercase
```

In this example:
- `production` applies **only** to assets that match both:
  - path regex `.*/production/.*`
  - and have a tag matching `critical`.

> [!note]
> Currently `policies` are only applied to `assets`. Support for `pipeline` level policies will be added in a future version.

## Custom Rules

Custom lint rules are defined inside the `custom_rules` section of `policy.yml`.

Each rule must include:
- **name**: A unique name for the rule.
- **description**: A human-readable description of the rule.
- **criteria**: An [expr](https://expr-lang.org/) boolean expression. If the expression evalutes to `true` then the asset passes validation.

### Example

```yaml
custom_rules:
  - name: asset_has_owner
    description: every asset should have an owner
    criteria: asset.Owner != ""
```

### Variables

`criteria` has the following variables available for use in your expressions:
| Name | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| [asset](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin/blob/f9c7d0083d2f53538102e77126e55f9dfc8840a5/pkg/pipeline/pipeline.go#L622-L645) | The asset selected via selector |
| [pipeline](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin/blob/f9c7d0083d2f53538102e77126e55f9dfc8840a5/pkg/pipeline/pipeline.go#L1106-L1121) | The pipeline the asset belongs to |

::: warning
The variables exposed here are direct Go structs, therefore it is recommended to check the latest version of these given structs. 

In the future we will create dedicated schemas for custom rules with standards around them.
:::

## Built-in Rules

Bruin provides a set of built-in lint rules that are ready to use without requiring a definition.

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `asset_name_is_lowercase` | Asset names must be in lowercase. |
| `asset_name_is_schema_dot_table` | Asset names must follow the format `schema.table`. |
| `asset_has_description` | Assets must have a description. |
| `asset_has_owner` | Assets must have an owner assigned. |
| `asset_has_columns` | Assets must define their columns. |

You can directly reference these rules in `rulesets[*].rules`.

## Full Example

```yaml
custom_rules:
  - name: asset_has_owner
    description: every asset should have an owner
    criteria: asset.Owner != ""

rulesets:
  - name: production
    selector:
      - path: .*/production/.*
      - tag: critical
    rules:
      - asset_has_owner
      - asset_name_is_lowercase
      - asset_has_description
  - name: staging
    selector:
      - asset: stage.*
      - pipeline: staging
    rules:
      - asset_name_is_lowercase
```
