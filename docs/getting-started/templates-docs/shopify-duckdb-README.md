# Bruin - Shopify to DuckDB

This pipeline is a simple example of a Bruin pipeline that copies data from Shopify to DuckDB. It demonstrates how to use the `bruin` CLI to build and run a pipeline.

The pipeline includes two sample assets already:
- `raw.shopify`: A simple ingestr asset that copies a table from Shopify to DuckDB

## Setup
The pipeline already includes an empty `.bruin.yml` file, fill it with your connections and environments. You can read more about connections [here](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/connections/overview.html).

Here's a sample `.bruin.yml` file:

```yaml
default_environment: default
environments:
    default:
        connections:
            duckdb:
                - name: "duckdb-default"
                  path: "<path to database>"

            shopify:
                - name: "my-shopify-connection"
                  api_key: "********"
                  url: "******.myshopify.com"
```
## Running the pipeline
bruin CLI can run the whole pipeline or any task with the downstreams:
```shell
bruin run assets/shopify.asset.yml
```

```shell
❯ bruin run ./templates/shopify-duckdb/                                                       (bruin) 
Analyzed the pipeline 'bruin-init' with 1 assets.

Pipeline: bruin-init (.)
  No issues found

✓ Successfully validated 1 assets across 1 pipeline, all good.

Starting the pipeline execution...

Executed 1 tasks in 9.656s
```

You can also run a single task:

```shell
bruin run assets/hello.py                            
```

```shell
❯ bruin run ./templates/shopify-duckdb/                                                       (bruin) 
Analyzed the pipeline 'bruin-init' with 1 assets.

Pipeline: bruin-init (.)
  No issues found

✓ Successfully validated 1 assets across 1 pipeline, all good.

Starting the pipeline execution...


Executed 1 tasks in 9.656s
```

You can optionally pass a `--downstream` flag to run the task with all of its downstreams.

That's it, good luck!


NOTE: Please find assets example for balance and transactions table in the [Shopify Cookbook](https://bruin-data.github.io/docs/cookbook/shopify-pipelines.html)
