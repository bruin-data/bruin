# Templates

We simplify the creation of pipelines through the use of **templates**. Templates provide a starting point with predefined structures, configurations, and connections to help you quickly set up and standardize your pipelines.

## What are templates?

Templates in Bruin are blueprints for initializing new pipelines. They:
- define the structure and essential files for a pipeline.
- contain boilerplate code and configurations tailored to specific use cases.
- allow users to quickly set up pipelines without starting from scratch.

By using templates, teams can focus on their pipeline logic rather than worrying about setup and configuration.
