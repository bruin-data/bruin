# What is Bruin?

Bruin is a data framework that consists of a command-line application & VS Code extension. It allows you to
- ingest data with pre-built connectors / Python
- transform data using Python and SQL
- add quality checks to your pipelines

You can use Bruin to build your data pipelines inside your data warehouse. It is a single-binary, which allows you to run it anywhere, e,g. your computer, GitHub Actions, or in an EC2 instance.

You can get started with Bruin [via installing it](./introduction/installation.md) with a single command.
