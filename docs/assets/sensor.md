# Sensor Assets

Sensor assets are a special type of asset that allows you to wait until a certain external event has occurred.

The most common use case of a sensor is when a piece of data is being produced by external systems, and you want to wait until that data is available before you start processing it.

Sensors are implemented on a per-platform basis, therefore some platforms may have more sensors than others.

Bruin CLI will run sensors once by default, you can change this behavior by setting the `--sensor-mode` flag to `skip` or `wait`.

## Why?

Sensors allow you to do a couple of things:

- Sensors are useful when you want to wait for an external event to occur before you start processing data.
  - For example, you may want to wait until a file is available in a certain location, or until a certain database table has been populated with data.
- They allow you to enforce quality checks on data that is produced outside of Bruin.
- They allow you to represent external assets within your data lineage and your data catalog.

> [!NOTE]
> Sensors are useful when your pipelines run on a schedule, rather than manual `bruin run` executions. You can control how sensors are executed via the `--sensor-mode` flag in `bruin run` command.

> [!WARNING]
> Bruin CLI supports working sensor implementations for some platforms such as BigQuery or Snowflake, but not all. [Bruin Cloud](https://getbruin.com) supports all sensors, and we are working on adding support for more platforms in Bruin CLI.

Sensors are a crucial part of integrating Bruin with external systems, and we are always happy to improve our sensor coverage.


### Poking Interval

Sensors work as a poking mechanism, they will check the status of the external event every few minutes until the event has occurred.

You can control how often the poking occurs via the `poke_interval` parameter, value being in seconds.

```yaml
name: my_sensor
type: bq.sensor.query
parameters:
    query: select count(*) > 0 from `your-project-id.raw.external_asset`
    poke_interval: 10 # seconds // [!code focus]
```

## Definition Schema

Sensors are defined as YAML files, with the naming schema `<name>.asset.yml`.

They support all the common properties of a Bruin asset, such as documentation, quality checks, and more.

```yaml
name: string
type: string
parameters:
    ... # custom parameters here
```

Here's an example BigQuery SQL sensor:

```yaml
name: raw.external_asset
type: bq.sensor.query
parameters:
    query: select count(*) > 0 from `your-project-id.raw.external_asset`
```

This asset will wait until the query returns any result.
