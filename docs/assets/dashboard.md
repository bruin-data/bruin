# Dashboard Assets

Dashboard assets serve as placeholders to represent where data is collected, queried, or visualized by any dashboarding tools in your pipeline.

They do not perform any computation, transformation, or data movement of their own, but instead are used to preserve an accurate overview of your data pipelineâ€™s lineage.

This helps you visualize and document the tools used in your data pipeline, making it easier to understand and maintain.

We support a variety of dashboard tools, including:
Amazon QuickSight, Apache Superset, Domo, Good Data, Grafana, Looker, Metabase, Mode BI, Power BI, Qlik Sense, Qlik View, Redash, Sisense, and Tableau.

## Definition Schema
Dashboard assets are defined using the extension `{asset_name}.asset.yml`. Here is an example of the schema:

```yaml
name: dashboard.quicksight
type: quicksight

depends:
    - schema.my_asset

owner: my-team@acme-corp.com

tags:
  - dashboard
  - team.xyz
```
