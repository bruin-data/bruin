## 3. Materialization

The Materialization tab allows you to configure how your asset is materialized in the database. This includes setting the type of materialization, partitioning, clustering, and specifying strategies for data handling.

### Features:

- **Materialization Type**:
  - **None**: No materialization.
  - **Table**: Materialize the asset as a table.
  - **View**: Materialize the asset as a view.

- **Strategy** (for Tables):
  - **Create + Replace**: Drop and recreate the table completely.
  - **Delete + Insert**: Delete existing data using an incremental key and insert new records.
  - **Append**: Add new rows without modifying existing data.
  - **Merge**: Update existing rows and insert new ones using primary keys.
  - **Time Interval**: Process time-based data using an incremental key.
  - **DDL**: Use DDL to create a new table using the information provided in the embedded Bruin section.

- **Partitioning**:
  - Select a column or manually enter an expression to partition the table by. Supports expressions such as date(col_name) or timestamp_trunc(col2, hour).

- **Clustering**:
  - Select multiple columns to cluster the table by. Clustering organizes data storage based on the specified columns, which can improve query performance.

- **Owner and Tags**:
  - **Owner**: Set or edit the owner of the asset. This can be useful for identifying who is responsible for the asset.
  - **Tags**: Add or remove tags to categorize and filter assets.

### How to Use:

1. **Select Materialization Type**:
   - Choose between `None`, `Table`, or `View` using the radio buttons.

   - Select a strategy from the dropdown menu. Each strategy has a description to help you understand its use case.

3. **Set Partitioning**:
   - Click on the partitioning input field and select a column from the dropdown list to partition your table.

4. **Set Clustering**:
   - Click on the clustering input field and select one or more columns from the dropdown list to cluster your table.

5. **Set Owner and Tags**:
   - Edit the owner by clicking on the edit icon next to the owner field. Changes are saved immediately.
   - Add or remove tags by clicking on the add or remove icons next to the tags field. Changes are saved immediately.

6. **Save Changes**:
   - Click the "Save Changes" button to apply your materialization settings for partitioning, clustering, and strategy.
