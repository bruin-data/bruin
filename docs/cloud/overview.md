# Overview

[Bruin Cloud](https://cloud.getbruin.com/register) is a managed cloud platform built on top of the open-source Bruin CLI. It provides a fully managed infrastructure for running, monitoring, and managing your Bruin pipelines at scale.

## What is Bruin Cloud?

Bruin Cloud takes the power of the open-source Bruin CLI and wraps it in a managed infrastructure, so you can focus on building data pipelines without worrying about deployment, scheduling, or infrastructure management.

### Key Features

- **Repository Integration**: Connects directly to your Git repositories and automatically deploys your Bruin pipelines
- **Managed Secrets & Connections**: Add and manage your database connections and secrets securely through the cloud interface
- **Automated Scheduling**: Enable pipelines to run on their defined schedules automatically
- **Flexible Run Options**: Create runs manually with options for regular runs, full refresh, and batched backfills
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Monitor runs, check logs, explore lineage, review quality checks, and analyze cost reports
- **Data Quality**: View table-level and column-level health checks to ensure data integrity
- **Built-in Data Catalog**: Discover and understand your data assets
- **Advanced Lineage**: Track data flow with column-level lineage capabilities
- **Cost & Usage Reporting**: Understand resource consumption and optimize costs
- **Dedicated Support**: Get support directly from the founding team

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Repository**: Link your Git repository containing Bruin pipelines to Bruin Cloud
2. **Configure Connections**: Add your database connections and secrets through the cloud interface
3. **Enable Pipelines**: Once enabled, pipelines start running automatically based on their defined schedules
4. **Monitor & Manage**: Use the cloud dashboard to monitor runs, debug issues, and track data quality
