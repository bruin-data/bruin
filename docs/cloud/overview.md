# Overview

[Bruin Cloud](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) is a cloud platform that offers a managed environment for Bruin pipelines.

It includes:
- a built-in data catalog
- serverless environment for all transformations
- cost & usage reporting
- advanced data lineage abilities, including column-level lineage
- support for data ingestion, data transformation, data quality and governance
- dedicated support from the founding team
- automated profiling of tables and columns

When table profiling is enabled on an asset, Bruin Cloud logs the daily row count of the table. If column profiling is enabled, Bruin Cloud captures statistics such as null count, mean, median, min, max and standard deviation for each profiled column. These metrics are displayed on the asset page.
