# Databricks

Databricks is a unified data analytics platform that provides a collaborative environment for data scientists, data engineers, and business analysts. It is built on top of Apache Spark, which makes it easy to scale and process big data workloads.

Bruin supports Databricks as a data platform.

## Connection

In order to work with Databricks you can add as a configuration item to `connections` in the `.bruin.yml` file complying with the following schema:

```yaml
    connections:
      databricks:
        - name: "connection_name"
          token: "your-databricks-token"
          path: "your-databricks-endpoint-path"
          host: "your-databricks-host"
          port: "your-databricks-port"
          catalog: "your-databricks-catalog"
          schema: "your-databricks-schema"
```

## Databricks Assets

### `databricks.sql`
Runs a materialized Databricks asset or a Databricks SQL script. For detailed parameters, you can check [Definition Schema](../assets/definition-schema.md) page.

#### Example: Create a table using table materialization
```sql
/* @bruin
name: events.install
type: databricks.sql
materialization:
    type: table
@bruin */

select user_id, ts, platform, country
from analytics.events
where event_name = "install"
```

#### Example: Run a script
```sql
/* @bruin
name: events.install
type: databricks.sql
@bruin */

create temp table first_installs as
select 
    user_id, 
    min(ts) as install_ts,
    min_by(platform, ts) as platform,
    min_by(country, ts) as country
from analytics.events
where event_name = "install"
group by 1;

create or replace table events.install
select
    user_id, 
    i.install_ts,
    i.platform, 
    i.country,
    a.channel,
from first_installs as i
join marketing.attribution as a
    using(user_id)
```
